# A* Search Algorithm for Finding Shortest Paths

This project implements the A* search algorithm to discover the shortest path between two given points. The A* search algorithm is a widely-used pathfinding algorithm known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## Heuristic Calculation

To efficiently determine the heuristic value, this project employs the Manhattan Distance calculation method. Manhattan Distance provides a heuristic estimate of the distance between two points in a grid-based system by calculating the sum of the absolute differences between their x and y coordinates.
