The A* search algorithm is a widely-used pathfinding algorithm known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## Heuristic Calculation

To efficiently determine the heuristic value, this project employs the Manhattan Distance calculation method.

Manhattan Distance provides a heuristic estimate of the distance between two points in a grid-based system by calculating the sum of the absolute differences between their x and y coordinates.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following key technologies:

- Priority Queue
- 2D Array
- Dictionary
- Pygame Library

The Pygame library is used for visualization purposes, providing an interactive display of the pathfinding process.
